# Big Data Computing

## Big Data phenomenon

* Technological progress
  * storage capacity
  * communication bandwidth
  * computing power
  * Reduction of ICT costs

* Digital Universe
  * Integration of digital technologies in every human activity
  * Scientific research (_produces a lot of data_)
  * Exponential growth of data

* Data can be either structured (_database records_) or unstructured (_textual data_)

## Application Domains

* The analysis of large datasets arises in:
  * Retailing: product improvement, recommandation systems
  * Banking/Finance: fraud detection...
  * Telecommunications: user profiling
  * Science: validation methods
  * Medicine: diagnosis/therapy
  * Social studies: IOT

## The Four V's of DATA

1. Volume
    * size of data poses several computational challenges and requires a __data-centric perspective__
2. Velocity
    * the data arrives at such high rate that tey cannot be stored and processed offline, but need to be processed in __streaming__
3. Variety
    * large datasets often come unconstructed and may relate to __very different scenarios__
4. Veracity
    * large datasets coming form real-word applications are likely to contain __noisy, uncerain__ data

* All points above require a __paradigm shift__ with respect to traditional computing

## Course presentation

### Main objectives

* Novel computing/programming frameworks for big data processing: theory and practice
  * _Spark_
* A sample of key primitives for data analysis
  * Rigorous setting (_be able to analitically predict what's going to happen_)
  * Algorithmic solutions with focus on large inputs

### Specific Content

* Computational Frameworks: MapReduce, Apache Spark
* Clustering primitives (_Professor's focus_)
* Graph analysis primitives
* Association analysis primitives (_Data mining_)
* Data stream processing

### Evaluation

* Written exam (_26 points_)
* Homeworks (_6+1 points_)
  * groups of max 3/4 sudents
  * 4 assignments, one every 2/3 weeks
  * Use of __Apache Spark__ on individual PCs (assignments 1-3) and __CloudVeneto__ (assignment 4)

### Online tools

* Moodle: forum, evaluation of homeworks and of written exams
* Uniweb: written exam lists, official final grades
